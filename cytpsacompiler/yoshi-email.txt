Li-Hua,
 
Please find attached the modified Cythonized TPSA with the capability of division, negative power, exponential, natural log, sqrt, sin, cos, and tan operations.
 
Some of the new functionality has not been sped up yet, but the results seem quite accurate. I checked against SymPy power series results. The worst case was some complex tangent operation with 1e-10 relative error. Otherwise, either absolute tolerance of 1e-16 or relative tolerance of 1e-12 were typical for all the newly added operations.
 
I still have to modify the portion of the code in jf1fastmap.py where passing TPS objects through elements with non-zero delta.
 
Please let me know if you have any question.

RE: upgraded Cython TPSA
Li-Hua,
 
I have implemented a version of Cython TPSA that can accept complex-valued coefficients.
 
I checked the coefficients against the results from SymPy in the function named “test_TPS_complex_coeff()” in the attached file “test_cytpsa.py”. This Python script will not run unless “SymPy” is also installed. But you can still see how I compute the TPSA you wanted to check.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.
